## v1 (devex+docs)

goalpost: mnist notebook in quill with rune + hugin

hugin
- fix plot3d

- run all

docs/website
- generate docs with odoc3 + dream-style html rewriting to integrate in www/
- favicon
- more tutorials

## notes

- use upstream metal library when insulated from camlkit
- (?) not sure we need non-polymorphic functions for perf of where, we should benchmark
- we can make jit composable by re raising all the effects (but what does it mean to write grad(jit(f)))?? What are the semantics in jax?
- (?) remove bigarray_ext (what's the best way to implement our C backend?)
- (?) think of using effects for prngs, does it simplify ux?
