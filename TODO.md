# todo

goalpost: jit-compiled gpt-oss at least as fast as {tinygrad,JAX,llama.cpp/vLLM} on {NVIDIA,NV,AMD}.
Where it stands, with every measurement: doc/performance.md.

## tolk

- AMD thread traces are not collected in a profile, and tracing through KFD
  is parked: after a GPU fault KFD runs none of the process's queues, so
  nothing can stop a running trace (one stayed on past its process's exit on
  nonnormal), and an eviction may move its window while it writes. rig's
  traced launch test runs only over PCI. The paths left are PCI and an
  amdgpu DRM submission, which holds its VMID and memory for the job
  (_plans/todo-campaign/sqtt/)

## talon, hugin, brot, munin, quill

- talon needs a query optimizer, a large design campaign, and the other
  optimization to match the best reference engines; 1.0 has no speed gate.
  Last measured against the faster of DuckDB 1.5.6 and Polars 1.44.2
  (9b82c5b57a, under load): decision support SF1 6.6x geomean, H2O 1e7
  group-by 2.1x, joins 2.0x, with talon using 3-10x the CPU. What the gap
  is made of: join filters pushed at run time and join reordering (DuckDB
  reads far fewer rows on q07, q08 and q12), scans (half the instructions
  of the five worst queries), aggregation (46% of q01), and possibly a
  segment-id reduce kernel in nx (unmeasured). Data: ~/wt/tmp/talon-data
