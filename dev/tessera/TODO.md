# tessera: what raven lacks

Friction met while building tessera, by the library that owns the fix. An
item leaves when its library fixes it, or when a design decides it stays.

## thumper

- A case cannot state its work, so reports show times only: `bench/`
  re-derives TFLOP/s and GB/s over `Thumper.measure`, and the rates never
  reach a baseline or `check`. Wanted: work (FLOPs, bytes) on a case,
  reported as rates.
- The `accept:`/`rerun:` hints drop a suite's own options, so a device
  flag would bless or rerun on the default device; `bench/` takes its device
  from `TESSERA_DEVICE` instead. Wanted: suite options the hints repeat.

## rig

- Every suite and example maps "cuda", "nv", "amd", "metal" to
  `Rig.open_ (Rig_x.gpu 0)` and forks a child to ask whether a GPU opens
  (its driver must not start before thumper forks): kaun's GPT-2, rune's
  bench, gpt-oss's bench and `bench/`. Wanted: opening a device by name,
  and asking whether it opens, in rig.

## nx

- A random draw on a GPU set needs a compiled program (one per shape and
  dtype), or a draw on the host placed over, which doubles host memory
  (8 GB of q, k, v at large's T = 256). Wanted: draws at a kernel-less
  placement, as creations already work.
- Floats narrower than float32 compute in float32 on the CPU, and nothing at
  the call says so: bf16 rows on the CPU time f32 kernels plus conversions.
- `Nx.split` returns a list, so taking a GRU's three gates needs a
  non-exhaustive match or slices.

## rune

- Running one body eagerly on the host and compiled on a GPU means writing
  `if jit then Rune.jit spec f else f` with an explicit signature at every
  call, even for `Nx.matmul`, and threading data the body uses (an
  attention bias) through the signature.
- Each new pixel count or sequence length compiles again: 191 small cases
  took 100 s cold on the host (Clang, one process per kernel), and the
  port's length buckets will meet the same cost.

## tolk

- TF32 is reached from user code as a compiler setting
  (`Tolk.Setting.context [B (allow_tf32, true)]`), NVIDIA only, and silently
  ignored elsewhere: a `tf32` row on AMD or the CPU measures f32. Wanted: a
  precision stated on the contraction, refused where no unit has it.

## kaun

- No GRU: v1.0's and v1.1's pooling is written by hand with `Rune.scan'`
  (about 25 lines with its walk). Wanted: a GRU cell and its scan, with
  PyTorch's gate layout so checkpoints map directly.
- `Layer_norm.apply` takes `?eps`, so it must be eta-expanded to pass to
  `Rune.jit`.

## Repository

- `bench/` cannot meet the 2-minute rule for a package's suite: its shapes
  are the point. Undecided: an exemption for `dev/`, a short default run
  with the full run behind an explicit command, or an alias of its own.
- A dune rule cannot pass the device choice through the passive build
  server, so a run on a chosen device runs the executable by hand.
