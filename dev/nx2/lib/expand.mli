(** Expansions: an operation's optional case as core operations, applied through
    [apply].

    A map of several nodes expands into one-node maps, one per node in order,
    each over the values of the nodes it reads; a constant or a coordinate is a
    creation of the map's shape. A reduction or a scan that is not plain, one
    monoid of its operand itself accumulated and rounded in the operand's dtype,
    expands into a map of each output it reduces into its accumulator ([float32]
    for the floats narrower than 32 bits, the byte-wide dtype for the sub-byte
    ones, the output's dtype otherwise), the plain loop, and a cast to the
    result's dtype. A sum of complex numbers sums their parts, read as floats
    along a last axis of two. [Moments] and [Arg] have no expansion yet. Every
    other operation is core. *)

val run :
  ('q. by:string -> 'q Value.prim -> 'q) ->
  by:string ->
  'r Value.prim ->
  'r option
(** [run apply ~by op] is [Some r], [r] [op]'s expansion applied through
    [apply], or [None] for a core case. *)
