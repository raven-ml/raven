# Documentation

Welcome to Raven's documentation. We're building a comprehensive ecosystem for scientific computing in OCaml, and this is where you'll find everything you need to get started.

## Start Here

If you're new to Raven, begin with the [introduction](/docs/introduction/) to understand what we're building and why. Then check out our [roadmap](/docs/roadmap/) to see where we're headed.

## Libraries

Each library in the Raven ecosystem serves a specific purpose:

- **[nx](/docs/nx/)** - N-dimensional arrays with pluggable backends (our NumPy)
- **[hugin](/docs/hugin/)** - Publication-quality plotting and visualization (our Matplotlib)
- **[quill](/docs/quill/)** - Interactive notebooks for scientific writing (our Jupyter)
- **[rune](/docs/rune/)** - Automatic differentiation with JIT compilation (our JAX)
- **[kaun](/docs/kaun/)** - Deep learning framework built on Rune (our PyTorch)
- **[sowilo](/docs/sowilo/)** - Computer vision framework built on Rune (our OpenCV)

## Status

Raven is in pre-alpha. We're actively building towards our first milestone: training MNIST with visualizations in a Quill notebook. Things will break, APIs will change, but we're building in public because we believe in the vision and want your feedback.
