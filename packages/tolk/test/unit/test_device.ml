(* Contract tests for [Device.Buffer.copy_from], the canonical buffer-to-buffer
   move. The device layer keeps no executor of its own: the realize engine
   installs one at initialization through [install_copy_runner], and copy_from
   delegates to it. These tests exercise that installed delegation on CPU
   buffers. The complementary fail-loud half — copy_from raising before any
   runner is installed — lives in test_device_no_engine, which never links the
   engine; see the note at the bottom of this file for why the two halves
   cannot share one executable. *)

   linker would drop [Realize] and copy_from would stay unbacked. The installed
   runner resolves the destination device by name, so the CPU opener must be
   registered too. *)

(* The fail-loud half of the contract — copy_from raising [Invalid_argument]
   before any runner is installed — cannot be observed here. The delegation
   tests above require the realize engine, and linking it runs the installer at
   module-initialization time, before [main], so the uninstalled state is gone
   by the time any test runs. test_device_no_engine covers that half in a
   separate executable that never references the engine. *)
