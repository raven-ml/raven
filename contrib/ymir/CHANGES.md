# Changelog

All notable changes to Ymir are documented in this file.

## Unreleased

- New package: exact physical units. `Ymir_units.Unit` is a unit as an exact
  monomial over primes, π and named symbols with rational exponents, with one
  canonical text (`to_string`, strict `of_string`), the SI's units, prefixes
  and exact defining constants, and `Unit.ratio`, a conversion factor
  correctly rounded to any nx dtype. `Ymir_units.Quantity` is a tensor in a
  unit, an `Nx.Ptree.S` that reports its unit's canonical text, with `value`
  and `convert` multiplying by that factor and raising on integer overflow.
- `Ymir_units.Constant` is a measured constant, a published decimal with its
  uncertainty, rounded once to a payload's dtype. `Ymir_units.Codata` holds
  the CODATA 2018 and 2022 releases, transcribed from NIST's tables.
